Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a study and also a process of creating solution-oriented software for real world problems. in the technology industry software
engineering is important because it helps in creating software that is user-friendly and user acceptable. This propels the industry in creating more software that 
users can relate with and use to accomplish daily tasks.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. mastering machines -  this is the period where machine language was prominent
2. mastering process -  now mastering software engineering and development
3. mastering complelxity -  when now OOP was introduced to help in modulation of systems.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. elicitation/ requirement gathering - this is the process of finding out what the user of the system needs from the system and the 
functionalities of the system. we now get system and user requirements.
2. system design - the system is designed to the specification of the user and system requirements. How the system will look like and how it will execute
   it's mandate to the satisfaction of the user.
3. system coding/ development- the designed system is now implemented in code format and created.
4. System implementation - the developed system is implemented/put into use in the intended environment after the system is tested.
5. system maintenance - the developed system undergoes the process of maintenance in the context of service delivery and but elimination. the system is evolved to match organizational or user dynamic requirements.
6. system documentation - the system is documented from the requirement elicitation process all the way to the maintenance process as long as the system is still in use.
   
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology does not allow changes in requirements to be executed while agile methodologies allow the system's dynamic nature to be considered.
agile - in an ERP development process, the system requirements of an organization can change and they must be incorporated into the ERP eg: addition of a new department.
waterfall - government projects with strict regularities etc.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer - 1. create a system specified by the requirements 
                     2. debugg the software to make sure the system delivers whatever is required.
                     3. test the system to assure all possible user input range is satisfied to eliminate the element of suprise.
                     4. train the users ofthe system to ensure they get how the system functions to allow smooth running business processes.
quality assurance engineer - 1. ensure that the software is upt standard as far human interaction interface is concerned
                             2. ensure that the software meets the global standard of softwares around the world.
                             3. ensure that the software is within the limits of specified requirements.
                             4. ensure that the software is delivering quality services to the users. to ensure satisfaction.
project manager -  1. oversee the development cycle.
                   2. provide essential tools for development eg, finances
                   3. ensure that the project is developed on time with no delays.
                   4. ensure that all the staff are working together to achieve the project goal.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are important in that: 1. the provide a simpe user-firiendly environment to create and run code.
                            2. they provide debugging tool to assistr in making sure software is running smoothly.
                            3. the provide tools for deployment after the project is done.
                            4. they have extensions that add on to the development process like helping complete code using AI.
                      examples include: android studio, visual studio code, pycharm and eclipse
Version Control systems are important in that: 1. they offer a way to track software code addition.
                                               2. they offer a way to make changes to code and test the code out without changing or manipulating the overall system in a safe                                                   way
                                          examples include: Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
challenges - 1. Users or software owners do not know what they want. the speak from business logic. (solution): have an intermediary that understands business logic and                       developer logic to assist the developer in understanding what the user requires of the system.
             2. users requirements keep changing over time. (solution) : incorporate agile development methodologies to assiste in keeping track with changing requirements.
             3. a feature to a user is a feature to the developer. (solution): the developer must have a business logic expert as stated above to expplain to the user what                    the feature does instead of putting it off as a bug.
             4. users might reject a system stating that the requirements are not met. (solution) : have a clearly written out requirement documentation with the help of a                    business donain expert to eradicate any misunderstanding between the user and the developer.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. unit testing - refers to a testing type which involves testing single modules on e by one to assure that they deliver or function as required. (importance): this ensures that each module is bug free and functions independently from other modules.
2. integration testing - this refers to testing of how modules or units (as stated above) function when put together.(importance): it tests whether as the systems are integrated together, whether they deliver whatis required of them.
3. system testing - this type of testing requires the tester to test the entire system as a whole to determine whether the system delivers as per the requirements as a whole.(importance) the system with it's integrated units must be able to deliver and satisfy what the user desires the system to do.
4. user acceptance - is the system appealing to the user? does the user accept the system when presented by the developer?. (importance): the test ensures that that the user accepts the system and is satisfied that the requirements have been met.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the process of defining clear, consise and on to the point requests in form of text which is fed to the AI prompt box to elicit clear response from the AI chat bot. it is important because it helps in getting clear response from the AI to assist in everyday tasks.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
example: what does the sun do?
correct prompt : what is the role of the sun in our galaxy, and how does it affect us on a regular basis.
